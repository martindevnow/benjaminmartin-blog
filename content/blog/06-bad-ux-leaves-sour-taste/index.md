title: "Bad UX Can Leave A Sour Taste"

description: On a recent visit to Vancouver, I was the victim of poor user experience because of non-sanitized user inputs leading to real world financial consequences. When this was brought to the attention of the enforcement agency, although I received a pardon on the parking ticket, I was given a verbal scolding (littered with odd syntax)

What drives good UX

- the tech gets out of the way
- no impediments
- forget you're using an automated system
- it it requires written instructions, it wasn't well designed.
  (like comments in code)

User data sanitization

- phone number entry
- postal codes
- dollar amounts
- license plate number!!

Unfamiliarity with the system & real world implications

- do i need to enter country code? how to we indicate that we need it or not>?

Story in Chronological order

- Flew to Vancouver, rented a car (from Alberta - License place `U-BLAAH` or w/e
- PayByPhone (they accepted my license place with `-`)
- Went to the aquarium in Stanley Park
- Came out to the car to see a parking ticket
- Went to EasyPark.ca to dispute it..
- tried to enter the license plate with a `-`, but the app said it was unrecognized.
- this told me everything I needed to know
- entered again without the `-`
- got in, sent my receipts, etc and filed my appeal
- waited tenuously all week to head back home without knowing whether the rental agency would be after me for this.
- 7 days after we had returned to Ontario, I finally heard back
- the email from them acknowledged the mistake, pardoned the violation, and scolded me (victim blaming)
- their attitude, and my fear of them changing their mind, prevented me from offering any potentially constructive feedback. :shrug:

Background:

- In Ontario, we have no special characters, just a space, but that could lead to the same issue for someone unfamiliar.
- some areas had multiple numbers for which "area" to register
- they claimed instructions are available on location
- i have pictures to review and upload

What could a better solution look like?

- take a photo of the license place, with location data, simple

Unique and novel experiences. This is what we're told to accumulate to ensure a long and colorful life.

Going on vacation is an ideal scenario to etch these experiences into our memories. The catch is that novel experiences can be good or bad. Both will leave a lasting impression on you. I recall learning in University, that a customer who has a negative experience will ten times as many people as a person who has a positive experience. I hope at least 10 people read this blog.

Earlier this year, the wife and I wanted to get away from Ontario, to shake the cabin fever of over a year under COVID restrictions. Neither of us had been to BC, so we book a flight and head there. Needless to say, we made many wonderful memories together, but allow me to go into a particular incident that left a sour taste in my mouth that didn't even have a resolution until we'd returned to Ontario.

One attraction we were quite excited to see and take our daughter to, was the aquarium on Stanley Island. (?)
